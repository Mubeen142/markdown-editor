## Custom Themes
Building custom themes is quite easy. Create the HTML wrapper for the editor with a textarea with id "editor". Then add the necessary buttons such as h1, h2, h3, bold etc to the editor and give them the right ids so the js file recognizes them and assigns the correct actions to them. Check the markdown.js file for all the button events available and the ids.
